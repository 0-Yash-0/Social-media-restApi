In this repository, I build RESTful Web Services using Spring Boot! In this project, I delve into web services, exploring why Spring, Spring MVC, and Spring Boot are a go-to framework combination for developing top-notch RESTful APIs. This project has equipped me with the knowledge and skills to build robust and scalable APIs.

I have covered a wide variety of topics while learning and working on this project:

Understanding RESTful Web Services: Get familiar with the principles and architecture behind RESTful APIs.

* Implementation with Spring and Spring Boot: Dived into implementing RESTful Web Services using Spring and Spring Boot, harnessing their powerful features to simplify development.

* Best Practices in Designing RESTful Web Services: Explored the best practices for designing RESTful APIs, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and usability.

* Resource Design and Operations: Designing resources and implementing essential operations like GET, POST, and DELETE.

* Validation and Exception Handling: Implementing validation for data integrity and handling exceptions gracefully for a better user experience.

* HATEOAS Implementation: Implemented HATEOAS to enrich API with navigational links.

* Versioning RESTful Services: Explore different approaches to versioning RESTful services and choose the best strategy.
* Using Postman: Learned to use Postman for effective testing and request execution.

* Basic Authentication with Spring Security: Secure your RESTful services with basic authentication to protect sensitive data.
* Filtering for RESTful Services: Implement filtering to allow clients to retrieve specific data subsets.

* Monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator: Utilized Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring and managing RESTful services.

* Documentation with Swagger: Documented this RESTful API using Swagger for improved understanding and consumption.

* Connecting to a Backend with JPA: Integrated RESTful services with a backend using JPA for seamless data storage and retrieval.
